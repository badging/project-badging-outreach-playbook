## Conversation Flow: How to Talk About Project Badging

### Start with the need
- Highlight why DEI matters in open source projects.  
- Emphasize that diverse, inclusive communities are healthier, more sustainable, and more attractive to contributors and sponsors.  
- Position Project Badging as a way to reflect on current practices and show commitment.

**Example:**  
> “Many projects want to grow in inclusivity but aren’t always sure how to show or measure that progress. That’s where Project Badging comes in.”

### Present the opportunity
- Explain that Project Badging is not about passing or failing — it’s about self-reflection and visibility.  
- Mention that the badge provides external recognition while also guiding internal improvements.  
- Highlight that it uses CHAOSS DEI metrics developed openly and collaboratively, giving it credibility.

**Example:**  
> “This process helps your project think carefully about DEI and gives you a badge you can display to signal that commitment to your community members and sponsors.”

### Talk about success stories
- Sharing examples helps projects see that badging is both possible and impactful. See Django's [blog post](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/jan/19/django-earns-the-chaoss-dei-bronze-badge/).  

**Example:**  
> “Other well-known projects like Gitlab, Kalilinux, Django, and CHAOSS itself have earned badges, and they use them to signal their ongoing DEI commitment.”

### Offer support
- Emphasize the low barrier to entry — it’s about honest reflection, not perfection.  
- Offer to walk them through the process if they want.  

**Example:**  
> “We can walk you through the application. It’s not about being perfect — just about being open to improvement.”

### Invite to act
- Encourage them to take the next step, but keep it approachable and low-pressure.  
- Offer a concrete timeframe that makes it feel achievable.  

**Example:**  
> “Would your team be open to learning more or applying for a badge this month? It usually only takes a few hours.”

## Objection Handling
Here are some examples of concerns and how you can provide encouragement:
- **Too small** → Even small projects benefit. The badge can help you grow.  
- **No DEI expertise** → You don’t need any — it’s about documenting current practices. We will guide you.  
- **No time** → Takes only a few hours, builds on what you already have.  
- **Worried about failing** → There’s no failing. Every project gets support if they want.
