# CHAOSS DEI Project Badging Outreach Playbook

Welcome to the CHAOSS DEI Project Badging Outreach Playbook. This playbook is designed to equip DEI Working Group members, DEI advocates, community liaisons, and the larger CHAOSS community to confidently explain, promote, and support the global adoption of the CHAOSS Project Badging initiative.

It is especially useful for anyone doing outreach, presentations, or 1:1 engagement about Project Badging.
