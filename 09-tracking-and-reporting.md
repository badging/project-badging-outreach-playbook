## Tracking and Reporting

To measure outreach impact, log your efforts:

- Date of outreach  
- Who you engaged (name, project, role)  
- What was shared (talk, email, meeting)  
- Current status (interested, applied, badged, no response)  

Please use this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eFjalXuNnkXWPzXxx6UgUgyCZeknFtORKuC3VGTDBhM/edit?gid=510776660#gid=510776660) to log your report.
