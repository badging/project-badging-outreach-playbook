## Key Talking Points

_When introducing Project Badging, keep your message simple and structured around the **Why, What, and How**._

### Why It Matters
- Healthy open source projects are diverse, equitable, and welcoming.  
- Sponsors, contributors, and partners look for visible signals of community health.  
- Project Badging helps projects reflect honestly on DEI practices and demonstrate commitment.

### What Project Badging Is
- A CHAOSS initiative that recognizes projects committed to DEI.  
- Uses openly developed CHAOSS DEI metrics as benchmarks.  
- Not a test or certification — it’s about self-reflection, learning, and visibility.  
- Projects earn a badge they can display on their README, website, and documentation.

### How It Works
- Review DEI practices using 4 CHAOSS DEI metrics: Project Access, Inclusive Leadership, Communication Transparency, and Newcomer Experience.  
- Document reflections in a `DEI.md` file at the root of your repository using the template as a guide.  
- Apply via the Project Badging website.  
- The bot reviews your `DEI.md`. If successful, you receive a bronze badge.  
- Re-apply annually to keep it current. Future levels (Silver, Gold, Platinum) will follow.
