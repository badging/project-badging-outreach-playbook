**Subject:** Showcase Your Project‚Äôs Commitment to DEI with a CHAOSS DEI Project Badge  

_Hello [Project Maintainer Name],_  

_I hope this email finds you well! I am reaching out from the CHAOSS DEI Working Group. CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software) is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating metrics, metrics models, and software to better understand open source community health on a global scale._

_We are inviting projects like yours to apply for the CHAOSS Project DEI Badge, which is a recognition of open source projects/communities that demonstrate a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. The badge not only reflects your project‚Äôs values, but also signals to potential contributors and sponsors that community health is your priority.  
The application process is simple, and our team will support you every step of the way. If successful, your project will earn a badge you can proudly display in your README, documentation, or website._  

_Would you be open to learning more or starting an application this month? It usually only takes a few hours, and the impact on community trust and visibility can be lasting._ 

_Looking forward to your response._  

_Warm regards,  
[Your Name]  
Member, CHAOSS DEI Working Group_
