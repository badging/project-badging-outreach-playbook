## What is Project Badging?

Project Badging is a CHAOSS initiative designed to recognize open source projects that exemplify best practices and demonstrate a strong commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) within their communities. The initiative uses CHAOSS DEI metrics—developed in an open, transparent, and collaborative process—as benchmarks for reflecting on DEI efforts in open source projects.

When projects apply for a badge, they engage in a self-reflection process that encourages them to evaluate how DEI practices are embedded in their communities. This process supports project owners and mainatiners in making informed decisions and taking thoughtful actions to foster a more inclusive and equitable environment.

Earning a badge allows projects to signal their ongoing efforts to prioritize DEI and, by extension, the overall health of their communities. This visible commitment can help attract a broader, more diverse contributor base and inspire confidence among potential contributors and sponsors.
