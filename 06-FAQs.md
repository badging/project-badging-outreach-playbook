## FAQs
**Q: What if we don’t qualify for a badge?**  
A: This isn’t about passing or failing. The goal is reflection and improvement, not perfection.

**Q: How much time does the application take?**  
A: Most projects complete the `DEI.md` file and application in just a few hours. It depends on how much you already have documented.

**Q: Do we need to make big changes before applying?**  
A: No — the application is about documenting your current practices honestly. You can always update later as your DEI work grows.

**Q: Who should be involved in this process?**  
A: Usually project maintainers, admins, or community organisers lead the process, but it’s even better if they invite contributors to give input.

**Q: What happens after we apply?**  
A: The badging bot reviews your `DEI.md` to check that it covers the four CHAOSS DEI metrics. If successful, you receive a badge you can display anywhere you showcase your project.

**Q: How long is the badge valid?**  
A: About a year. We encourage projects to re-apply annually to keep their badge current and show ongoing commitment.

**Q: Are there different levels of badges?**  
A: Right now there is only one level, but new levels like Silver, Gold, and Platinum are planned for the future as CHAOSS metrics for the Project Badging expand.
