## How to be an Effective Outreach Ambassador
As an outreach ambassador, your role is to encourage, support, and guide projects through the CHAOSS Project Badging process. You are not a gatekeeper, you don’t judge readiness or expertise. Instead, you:

- Introduce projects to the initiative.  
- Explain the benefits of applying.  
- Walk them through the application steps.  
- Share resources and answer common questions.  
- Encourage re-application and continued engagement.  

### Best Practices

**Do:**  
- Listen first and adapt to the project’s context.  
- Frame badging as supportive, not evaluative.  
- Share benefits and success stories.  
- Encourage honesty and reflection.  
- Provide resources and follow up kindly.  

**Don’t:**  
- Oversell it as a compliance certification.  
- Pressure projects with guilt or urgency.  
- Criticize projects for lack of DEI practices.  
- Overwhelm them with too much detail at first contact.  

Think of yourself as a bridge — you help projects see that DEI work is achievable, valuable, and supported by the CHAOSS community.
