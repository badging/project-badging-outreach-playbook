## Follow Up
Following up is an important part of outreach, but it should always feel supportive, not pushy.

### Timing
- First follow-up: 1–2 weeks after initial contact if there’s no response.  
- Second follow-up: 2–3 weeks later, keeping the tone friendly and low-pressure.  
- Final follow-up: One last check-in a month later, offering resources and leaving the door open.  

After three attempts, it’s okay to stop unless the project re-engages.

### Tone
- Keep messages brief, friendly, and supportive.  
- Assume positive intent (people are busy, not uninterested).  
- Always emphasize that the process is simple, supported, and non-judgmental.

### Message Content
- **Follow-up #1:** Gentle reminder, re-share the link to apply, highlight one clear benefit.  
- **Follow-up #2:** Share a success story or example project to inspire action.  
- **Follow-up #3:** Leave the door open — “Whenever your team is ready, we are here to support you.”

### When to Stop
- After 3 unanswered follow-ups.  
- If the project explicitly declines.  
- If they say “not now,” make a note to circle back in 6–12 months.
